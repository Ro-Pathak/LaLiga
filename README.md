# LaLiga

The aim is to develop a predictive model using the H2O machine learning framework that can accurately predict the number of goals scored by a player based on their actions during a game, using a Laliga dataset. The dataset contains information on various player actions such as shots taken, successful passes, successful dribbles, etc. and the corresponding number of goals scored by each player in each game. The goal of this project is to create a model that can take these action features as input and predict the number of goals a player is likely to score in a given game. This model could be used by coaches, scouts, and analysts to identify players who are likely to be more effective goal scorers, or to optimize team strategy by identifying areas where players could improve their performance. The challenge is to identify the most important action features that are most strongly correlated with goal scoring, and to develop a model that can accurately predict goals scored based on these features. Thus, we further use Explainable AI (XAI) from the DALEXtra library package to identify them.
